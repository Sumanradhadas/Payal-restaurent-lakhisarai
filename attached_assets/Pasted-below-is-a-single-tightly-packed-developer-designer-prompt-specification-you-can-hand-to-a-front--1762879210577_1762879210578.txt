below is a single, tightly-packed developer/designer prompt & specification you can hand to a front-end dev, a website builder, or feed into an AI code generator to produce a purely static site for Payal Restaurant (Lakhisarai, Bihar). It is deployment-ready for Netlify’s free plan and includes everything you asked for: page-by-page content, exact copy for popups/CTAs/disclaimer/credits, SEO/meta guidance, what the XML files should contain, sitemap/robots/Search Console steps, UX/animation notes, accessibility, performance, and final checklist. This is a description only (no source code), ready for implementation — replace placeholder domain/URLs with your real domain before publishing.

Project brief (single sentence)

Create a modern, fast, fully static, SEO-first website for Payal Restaurant (Lakhisarai, Bihar) — responsive HTML + CSS + vanilla JS only — optimized for Netlify free hosting and Google indexing, with a tasteful opening pop-up crediting WebGlow, a menu disclaimer, rich SEO metadata, sitemap & robots XML, JSON-LD LocalBusiness schema (to be added), and smooth modern CSS animations and transitions.

Global CSS file (modern responsive layout + variables + microinteraction classes).

Single vanilla JS file for small behaviors: opening popup, mobile nav, lazy image loader, form validation, analytics opt-in, and menu disclaimer toggle.

One sitemap.xml and one robots.txt.

Visual / UI / animation guidance (modern, subtle, high-quality)

Add image pointing to the primary photo or logo. (Developer to add valid JSON-LD script in <head>.)

XML files & Search Console readiness (what to create and submit)

sitemap.xml (what it should contain)

A sitemap listing all canonical URLs (index, menu, about, gallery, contact, credits, privacy) with <loc>, <lastmod> (YYYY-MM-DD), <changefreq> (e.g., monthly or weekly for menu), and <priority> (0.8 for homepage).

If more than 50–1000 URLs later, split into sitemap index.

robots.txt (what it should contain)

Allow: / for search bots.

Point to sitemap location: Sitemap: https://<YOUR_DOMAIN>/sitemap.xml.

Disallow sensitive paths (e.g., /admin/, /cgi-bin/) — none expected for static site.

Google Search Console steps (deploy-ready checklist)

Deploy site to Netlify and confirm the live URL (or custom domain).

In Google Search Console, add property (choose Domain or URL prefix).

Verify ownership (Netlify DNS TXT or HTML file).

Submit sitemap.xml via Search Console > Sitemaps.

Check Coverage report for indexing issues and fix any 4xx/5xx or blocked resources.

Use URL Inspection to request indexing for the homepage and key pages.

Monitor Performance report for impressions & queries, iterate on meta titles/descriptions and structured data.

Bing / other search engines: submit sitemap via Bing Webmaster Tools as well.

Netlify deployment notes (what to include)

Project has no build step (pure static): set Netlify publish directory to project root or /public.

Provide a netlify.toml description: set publish folder, redirect rules (if any), and headers for caching & security. Important headers to add: Cache-Control for images, Content-Security-Policy minimal, X-Frame-Options: DENY.

Setup a custom domain and HTTPS (Netlify offers free Let’s Encrypt).

Enable Netlify Forms if using the contact form — include data-netlify="true" attribute or provide form action to a simple mail service.

Add _headers file or configure headers in Netlify to set long cache TTLs for static assets and short TTL for HTML.

Performance & technical SEO checklist (must do)

Serve images as WebP + fallback JPEG; create responsive srcset. Use LQIP/blur-up.

Inline critical CSS for top-of-page render; defer the rest.

Minify CSS and JS. Combine small assets where it helps.

Use modern HTTP caching headers (long cache for images/css, short for html).

Make sure pages are mobile-first and pass Core Web Vitals: LCP < 2.5s, FID/INP low, CLS stable.

Preconnect to critical origins (Google Maps) only if used.

Use semantic HTML (header, nav, main, footer).

Add lang="en-IN" or lang="hi" as appropriate in <html> element.

Accessibility (a11y) must-haves

All images have descriptive alt attributes (e.g., “Payal Restaurant exterior — Nawada-Sikandara-Lakhisarai Rd”).

Proper heading hierarchy (H1 per page).

Sufficient color contrast for text.

Keyboard focus states for interactive elements and focus trap avoidance in modals.

Respect prefers-reduced-motion.

Label contact form inputs and use ARIA where necessary.

Content snippets you must include exactly (copy/paste)

Menu disclaimer (place at top of menu page):
“Disclaimer: Menu items and prices shown here are compiled from public listings and are for reference only. For the official menu and current prices please contact the restaurant directly at +91 63462 33115.”

Footer credit (small):
“Website design & build: WebGlow — https://webglowx.onrender.com/”
 and show logo (https://webglowx.onrender.com/logo.png
).

Popup CTA button (mailto): Contact WebGlow → mailto:webglow@zohomail.in

Primary contact text: Call: +91 63462 33115

SEO meta description (homepage): (use the earlier suggested description above exactly).

Suggested keywords & ad copy / promotional phrases

Keywords: Lakhisarai restaurant, vegetarian thali Lakhisarai, payal restaurant menu, best food Lakhisarai, thali near Sahid Dwar.

Short ad lines for banners/buttons:

“Homely Thalis, Fresh Every Day.”

“Large family portions — pocket friendly.”

“Order now on Zomato & Swiggy — fast local delivery.”

“Visit Payal Restaurant — near Purani Bazar, Lakhisarai.”

Use one-liners on homepage hero: “Taste Lakhisarai’s favourite homestyle thali.”

Analytics & privacy (recommendations)

Add optional Google Analytics 4 (use consent banner). Do not force-load analytics until visitor consents.

Consider server-side or Netlify Forms for contact submissions; avoid exposing emails in plain text (but mailto is okay for CTA).

Add a small cookie/consent banner.

Images / logo (use these exact resources)

Primary logo (to be embedded in header & footer): https://webglowx.onrender.com/logo.png (use as PNG with transparent background).

Social preview / og:image: choose a high-res food photo or the logo if no photo available. Provide multiple sizes (1200×630 recommended).

All images must be optimized and credited if pulled from third-party listings.

Security & legal (small notes)

Do not publish personal phone numbers other than the official business number. Confirm with the owner before publishing.

If using user reviews from directories, attribute them and avoid quoting more than 25 words verbatim unless permitted.

Add a short privacy notice (what data is collected, form processing).

Final SEO push (practical items to push ranking)

Validate JSON-LD LocalBusiness and add business sameAs URLs (Zomato, Swiggy, JustDial, Google Maps) to help entity recognition.

Create a Google My Business / Business Profile listing and ensure NAP (Name, Address, Phone) consistency.

Have at least 3–5 high quality images with alt text and captions.

Submit sitemap.xml to Search Console and use URL Inspection to submit main pages for indexing.

Build at least 2–3 inbound links from local directories and social profiles (Zomato, Swiggy, JustDial, Facebook page).

Keep content focused on local keywords: include “Lakhisarai”, neighborhood names, and common dish names.

Implementation & deployment checklist (final)

 Replace placeholder domain with Netlify URL or custom domain.

 Insert exact contact phone and confirm hours with owner.

 Add JSON-LD and test in Rich Results testing tool.

 Generate sitemap.xml with correct full URLs and add to robots.txt.

 Deploy to Netlify, verify HTTPS and mobile rendering.
